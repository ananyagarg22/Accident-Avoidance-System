# Accident-Avoidance-System
This is an Arduino based accident avoidance system that calculates the distance between two vehicles using a microcontroller and ultrasonic distance sensor and warns the driver using a led and a buzzer, hence avoiding an accident.

This project aims at creating forward collision mitigation system that provides a level playing ground for all vehicles, regardless of make, age, type or model, when it comes to possible safety risk one can face on the road and at a minimal cost.

This kind of system is the fastest growing safety feature in automotive industries. Such a system enables vehicles to identify the chances of collision and give visual and audio warning to driver, so that the driver can take necessary action to avoid collision. This project idea is based on an Arduino controller and the whole project will gives us a very good understanding of how this system works.
